# My C programs from 2000-02

----------

## Introduction
This repo contains some of the C programs I developed during my post graduation in IIT Roorkee, i.e. way back in 2000-02.

Recently I was browsing one of my old email accounts and came across an archive, which contained these small, simple programs. There are a few programs which I developed while preparing for campus placements going thru at Shakuntla Devi's 2 wonderful puzzle books. Some of the examples are like amicable numbers, perfect numbers, etc. Also, I seem to have written few sorting related programs too. Using various sorting algos like Bubble, Heap, Quick, Binary, etc.

During that time, I remember using Turbo C on my 64 MB RAM machine for developing these programs. I used to execute these programs on a Unix dumb terminal at IIT Roorkee Civil Engineering CAD Lab. Those were the days!

I dint try to run any of these programs now, just added a repo on GitHub and pushed the code here.

I also added screenshots of the file timestamps just for my reference. :joy:

## Disclaimer
I uploaded these files to GitHub just for nostalgic vibes. So, please don't try running them. I am not even sure how many of them will run fine or will fail to even compile too.
